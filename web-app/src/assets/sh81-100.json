IDAP is an interest-free loan that must be repaid once a case is decided.\n\nProtective Payee Services\nCommunity Advocates provides Protective Payee services (rent payment and other allowances for necessities and discretionary spending) to individuals who are unable to adequately manage their finances. Protective Payee services are provided on a fee-for-service basis and allow clients to establish a history of bill payment, thereby improving their credit. \n\nLegal Referrals\nCommunity Advocates can provide referrals for legal representation in Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) appeals.\n\nSSI Advocacy\nSSI Advocacy provides information, representation, referrals, and advocacy for individuals seeking Social Security disability benefits. In addition to direct representation on disability benefits appeals, staff work to ensure that clients have access to the resources and services they need during the appeals process and beyond. \nThis program accepts referrals only from Children's Community Health Plan, Managed Health Services, and Kenosha Department of Human Services."
