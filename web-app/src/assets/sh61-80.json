The group is held twice monthly.\n\nThe Muhindi Program helps parents take a more positive and engaged role in their children’s educations. Nia Imani Family staff sometimes accompany parents to parent/teacher conferences, particularly when children have special needs or have been identified as being behind in school.\nMothers and Children Gathering Program: One evening every week, mothers and their children gather in our common area to read and play and learn together. was born from our recognition that parents needed time to socialize with each other in a safe setting that also built up bonds with their children. Many of the children at Nia Imani have experienced traumas—the breakup of their family unit, homelessness, violence, parental incarceration and substance abuse, and/or time in and out of the foster care system. Many of these children also have educational, behavioral or emotional special needs\n\nPIWI: Parent Interacting With Infants: The sessions vary, with a range of activities that focus on mother/child bonding, parent/child interaction, parenting support, and focused activities that involve parents with their child\n\nMothers-only Reading Book Club: A volunteer-led weekly program. Women read aloud from and discuss books. A light meal or snack is included. Over time, improvements in reading abilities and confidence levels are usually quite obvious. As women become more comfortable, they tend to participate more in discussions and by volunteering to read.\n\nParenting Group: Weekly program by The Milwaukee Health Department to help support mothers in their parenting.\n\nFamily Time: Moms must plan a special outing—such as a museum or library visit—to enjoy with their children once per month. Families are encouraged to explore community resources."
