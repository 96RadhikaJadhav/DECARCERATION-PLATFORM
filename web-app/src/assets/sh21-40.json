Over 90% of program participants are ex-offenders and enrolled in a child support program. Eighty-five percent of the individuals enrolled were placed in subsidized employment.\n\nThe rural Northeastern Transitional Jobs program is operated, in partnership with the Menominee Tribal Enterprise in the Wisconsin Counties of Menominee, Langlade, Forest and Florence. Over 65% of participants were placed in unsubsidized employment.\n\nUMOS recently received $1.5 million in additional funds to expand, in partnership with the Ho-Chunk Nation, into the rural South-Central Wisconsin areas of Juneau, Adams, Jackson, and Clark Counties.\n\nThe UMOS Transform Milwaukee Jobs Program and Transitional Jobs Program are funded by the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families."

Circles of Support are small groups that meet regularly to provide a stable, supportive network to men and women returning from incarceration. \n\nâ€‹Members of each circle include formerly incarcerated people, a trained circle keeper, and community volunteers. Through a structured process, members grow with each other, learn from one another, and help the community heal from the trauma experienced through poverty and crime. \n\nCircles have started at three locations: St. Benâ€™s Parish, Project RETURNâ€™s offices, and Hephatha Lutheran Church. Additional sites have expressed interest in hosting circles in 2019."
